name: kick-off
description: Orchestrate significant development work from a single request — evaluates scope, interviews for missing context, scans existing rules and skills, produces a design doc in design-docs/, then decomposes the work into TDD-driven multitask subagent phases. Use when the user says /kick-off, wants to start a new feature, requests deep module implementation, asks to create a design doc first, or wants work broken into parallel tasks with TDD Red-to-Green enforcement.

# Kick-off Orchestration

**Before doing anything else:**
1. Call `SwitchMode` with `target_mode_id: "plan"` — this session is planning-only until the user approves the design doc.
2. Use model `claude-4.6-opus-high-thinking` (Opus 4.6) for all reasoning in this workflow. If a subagent is dispatched, pass `model: "claude-4.6-opus-high-thinking"` in the Task tool call.

Run this workflow top-to-bottom. Do not skip phases. Each phase gates the next.

---

## Phase 0: Request Intake and Classification

Read the user's request and produce a classification block:

```
Type:  new-feature | enhancement | bug-fix | refactor | spike
Scope: small (1-3 files) | medium (4-10 files) | large (10+ files)
Layers touched: server | client | shared | db | (multiple)
```

**Routing decision:**

- `small` scope AND not `new-feature` → skip Phase 3 (design doc), proceed directly to Phase 4 (TDD decomposition)
- All other cases → Phase 3 is mandatory before any implementation

State the classification block to the user before moving on.

---

## Phase 1: Interview (Context Gathering)

Run this phase if **any** of the following is true:
- The request is missing acceptance criteria
- The affected layers are unclear
- The request could be implemented multiple valid ways with significant trade-offs
- Scope could not be estimated confidently in Phase 0

Ask using the `AskQuestion` tool when it is available; ask conversationally otherwise. Cap at **2 rounds** of questions, then proceed with best available context.

**Core questions (adapt as needed):**

1. **What**: What problem does this solve? What should be true after it is done?
2. **Where**: Which layers are affected — server, client, shared types, DB migrations, or all?
3. **How**: Are there existing patterns or constraints to follow? (e.g. "match the RBAC service pattern")
4. **Dependencies**: Does this depend on or block any other in-flight work?
5. **Done criteria**: What is the minimum that must be true for this to be considered complete?

After gathering answers, write a one-paragraph **Scope Summary** and confirm it with the user before continuing.

---

## Phase 2: Skills and Rules Evaluation

Read and evaluate these project assets before writing any code or design doc:

**Rules to read** (`.cursor/rules/*.mdc`):
- `scope-discipline.mdc` — always applies; note any protected files that would be touched
- `typescript-typecheck.mdc` — applies to all `.ts`/`.tsx` changes
- `react-coding-standards.mdc` — applies when client `.tsx` files are involved
- `ui-design-standards.mdc` — applies when CSS or new components are involved
- `postgresql-db.mdc` — applies when DB queries, schema, or migrations are involved
- `rbac-governance.mdc` — applies when client UI features are added or removed
- `pre-deployment-cloud.mdc` — applies if file storage or server-startup code is touched

**Skills to check** (`.cursor/skills/*/SKILL.md`):
- `fullstack-node-bff` — load for any route, hook, or shared-type work
- `postgresql-migrations` — load when a DB migration is needed
- `rbac-management` — load when RBAC adds/removes/modifies permissions

> **Skill resolution note:** If the feature involves resolving which skill repo/branch to use for an AI agent session, use `useProjectSkillConfig` (from `src/client/hooks/useProjectSkillConfig.ts`) as the canonical source for repo + branch. Do not hardcode branch names or let users pick repos manually. The admin-managed `project_skill_settings` table (managed via `/admin/project-settings`) is the source of truth.

Output a **Context Block** in this format — paste it into every subagent prompt generated in Phase 4:

```
## Context Block (inject into all subagent prompts)
Applicable rules: <comma-separated list>
Load these skills: <comma-separated list, or "none">
Protected files requiring explicit permission: <list or "none">
Key existing files: <3-5 most relevant file paths>
```

---

## Phase 3: Design Doc Generation

> Skip this phase only for `small` non-`new-feature` requests.

Create `design-docs/<kebab-case-feature-name>.md` using the template at [design-doc-template.md](design-doc-template.md).

**Required frontmatter:**
- `name` — human title
- `overview` — 1-2 sentence summary
- `todos` — one item per distinct task, grouped into phases; IDs follow `phase-N-description`; all start as `status: pending`
- `isProject: false`

**Required body sections:**
1. Current State — what exists today and why it is insufficient
2. Architecture — Mermaid `flowchart TD` diagram of the proposed system
3. Database Schema — table definitions (omit if no DB changes)
4. Server Changes — service functions, middleware, routes with HTTP verbs and paths
5. Client Changes — hooks, components, styling approach
6. Key Design Decisions — trade-offs chosen and why
7. Phase Summary and Parallelization — Mermaid `flowchart LR` dependency graph plus a plain-English parallelism note per phase
8. Files Changed / Created — table of `Action | Path`

**Todo phasing rules:**
- Tasks within a phase have **no dependencies on each other** (safe to run in parallel)
- Phase N+1 tasks all depend on Phase N being complete
- Aim for 3-6 tasks per phase; phases beyond 6 tasks should be split

Confirm the design doc with the user ("Here is the design doc — shall I proceed to decompose into tasks?") before moving to Phase 4.

---

## Phase 4: Task Decomposition for Multitask Mode

For each `pending` todo in the design doc, produce a **subagent prompt block**. These are the prompts to paste into Cursor Multitask sessions.

**Subagent prompt structure:**

```
## Task: <todo id> — <todo content>

### Goal
<1-2 sentences describing the deliverable>

### Files to create or edit
<explicit list — no others unless unavoidable>

### Constraints
- Follow all rules in the Context Block below
- Load the skills listed in the Context Block before writing code
- Do NOT modify protected files without user approval

### TDD Instructions (see Phase 5 below)
<paste the TDD block for this task's layer>

### Cross-task contracts
<any interfaces, types, or function signatures this task must respect from prior phases>

<paste the Context Block from Phase 2>
```

**Dependency gating:** Explicitly label which phase each group of prompts belongs to. Tell the user:

> "Run Phase 1 prompts in Multitask. Only proceed to Phase 2 after all Phase 1 subagents pass type-check and tests."

---

## Phase 5: TDD Red-to-Green (include in every subagent prompt)

Paste the appropriate block into each subagent prompt based on which layer the task touches.

### Server task TDD block

```
TDD — Red to Green:

1. RED: Write src/server/__tests__/<module>.test.ts first.
   - Mock the Drizzle db instance: jest.mock('../db/drizzle', () => ({ db: { ... } }))
   - Follow the mock shape in src/server/__tests__/rbacService.test.ts
   - Use AAA (Arrange / Act / Assert); test public API only
   - Run: npm test -- <testfile> — confirm tests FAIL before writing implementation

2. GREEN: Write the implementation (minimum code to pass).
   - Run: npm test -- <testfile> — confirm all tests PASS

3. REFACTOR: Clean up; re-run tests to confirm still green.

4. TYPE-CHECK: npx tsc -p tsconfig.server.json --noEmit — fix all errors.
```

### Client task TDD block

```
TDD — Red to Green:

1. RED: Write src/client/components/__tests__/<Component>.test.tsx
        or src/client/hooks/__tests__/<hook>.test.ts first.
   - Use @testing-library/react + jest-environment-jsdom
   - Mock fetch and external hooks; use MSW or inline jest.fn() mocks
   - Use AAA pattern; test user-visible behavior, not implementation details
   - Run: npm test -- <testfile> — confirm tests FAIL before writing implementation

2. GREEN: Write the implementation.
   - Run: npm test -- <testfile> — confirm all tests PASS

3. REFACTOR: Clean up; re-run tests to confirm still green.

4. TYPE-CHECK: npx tsc -p tsconfig.client.json --noEmit — fix all errors.
```

### Shared-types task TDD block

```
TDD — Red to Green:

1. RED: Write tests that import and validate the new types/utilities.
   - For pure functions, use standard Jest unit tests
   - Run: npm test -- <testfile> — confirm tests FAIL

2. GREEN: Implement the types and utilities.
   - Run: npm test -- <testfile> — confirm PASS

3. TYPE-CHECK (both configs):
   npx tsc -p tsconfig.server.json --noEmit
   npx tsc -p tsconfig.client.json --noEmit
```

---

## Phase 6: Verification Gate

After all subagents in a phase complete, the **coordinator** (you, in the parent conversation) must:

1. Run type-check for all affected configs:
   ```bash
   npx tsc -p tsconfig.server.json --noEmit
   npx tsc -p tsconfig.client.json --noEmit
   ```
2. Run tests for all new test files:
   ```bash
   npm test -- --testPathPattern="<pattern covering new files>"
   ```
3. If failures: diagnose, fix inline or dispatch a targeted fix subagent, then re-run.
4. Update the design doc todos: change `status: pending` → `status: done` for completed tasks.
5. Only after all checks pass: dispatch Phase N+1 subagent prompts.

Report to the user after each phase gate:
> "Phase N complete. Type-check: ✓. Tests: ✓. Proceeding to Phase N+1."
