description: Keep changes scoped to what was asked — do not modify config, env, or infrastructure files unless explicitly requested

# Scope Discipline

Only change files **directly required** to fulfill the user's request. Do not touch config, environment, or infrastructure files as a side effect of debugging or troubleshooting.

## Files that require explicit permission to change

- `vite.config.ts`
- `src/server/index.ts`
- `src/server/routes/auth.ts`
- `.env.example`
- `tsconfig*.json`
- `jest.config.*`
- `package.json`
- Any CI/CD pipeline files (`.github/`, `azure-pipelines.yml`, etc.)

## Rule

If a runtime issue is encountered during development (port conflicts, auth errors, etc.) that seems to require config changes:

1. **Report the issue** to the user and explain what is causing it.
2. **Ask explicitly** before modifying any config/infrastructure files.
3. Do not bundle config changes into a feature implementation without asking.
